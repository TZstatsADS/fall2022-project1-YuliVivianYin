### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2022

+ Projec title: The relationship between philosophy, religion and science
+ This project is conducted by Yuli Yin (yy3086)

+ Project summary: Philosophy, science and religion are three endeavours that shape in fundamental ways of how we think, what we value, and how we live. This report aims to explore different philosophers’ perspectives on religion and science - how much did they care about those ideas (i.e. how often did they mention them) and how were their attitudes towards them (i.e. positive or negative).
